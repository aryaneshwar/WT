            <h2>About Me</h2>
           
            <p>
                <p>
         I am <strong>Aryan Eshwar </strong> a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at 
        <strong>RV Institute of technology and management</strong>, passionate about web development, programming, 
        and technology. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Over the past few years, I have honed my technical skills by working on various 
        <strong>projects</strong> and participating in hackathons, where I collaborated with teammates 
        to create functional prototypes within strict deadlines.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        I am proficient in front-end technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js,Solidity,Next.js</strong>, 
        and I have a foundational understanding of back-end programming in <strong>Python and Java</strong>. 
        My goal is to further specialize in full-stack development to build robust and scalable applications.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Apart from academics, I actively contribute to my college's <strong>Coding Club</strong> as an 
        organizer, conducting coding workshops and events to help students learn and grow in the tech space. 
        I also enjoy mentoring juniors on building their first web applications.
